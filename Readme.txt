Hey everyone, My name is Aditya Tomar. This is my personal project created using ReactJS and strapi. 
StreetSavvy is a modern and user-friendly online shopping platform that offers a wide range of clothing for both men and women. This web application is built using React.js for the front end, Node.js for the backend, and Strapi as the content management system. It provides a seamless shopping experience, enabling users to explore and purchase their favourite clothing items effortlessly.
The website features a dynamic shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items as they browse the collection. Users can easily view their selected items, see the total cost and can be used to checkout after shopping.
To ensure secure and convenient transactions, the website integrates with Stripe, and users can make payments ensuring a smooth and reliable payment experience.
